###My solution to###
##Data Structures and Algorithms with Object-Oriented Design Patterns in Python##

It is a [web book](http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus7/html/book.html) teaching implementation of 
essential data structures and algorithms using Python, written by [*Bruno R. Preiss*](http://www.brpreiss.com).
I start studying it a week ago. It has projects for every chapter, but no solution included. 
While I am not 100% percent my solution is correct, they could get you started at least.

Welcome to fork and modify the solution, and send me pull requests to improve it.
